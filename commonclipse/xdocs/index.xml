      	Commonclipse is an eclipse plugin for jakarta commons-lang users.
      	It features automatic generation of the following methods using commons-lang builders:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>toString()</li>
        <li>hashcode()</li>
        <li>equals(Object)</li>
        <li>compareTo(Object)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
      	Commonclipse supports customization of generated methods (custom ToStringStyle, 
      	use of appendSuper(), excluded fields) through user defined properties.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      	Commonclipse menu is available on java editor views or in the package explorer. 
      	See <a href="screenshots.html">screenshots</a>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      	Built methods use jakarta commons-lang 2.0 builders.
      	Commonclipse will not check for the presence of commons-lang in your project classpath, you need to get
      	a copy from <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/lang">jakarta</a> and to set up java build path
      	appropriately.
      </p>

       <p>
      	<strong>Current build is compatible with eclipse 2.x and any 3.0 build.</strong>
      </p>
      
      <p>
      	Is this another eclipse "toString plugin"? Well, there are many eclipse plugins providing automatic
      	creation of basic methods, but none of them allows you to use commons-lang builders:
      	that's the reason for Commonclipse.
